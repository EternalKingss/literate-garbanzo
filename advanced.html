                        <li><strong>Positioning Impact:</strong> With 1 Range hero, your middle Range squad sticks out toward the enemy</li>
                        <li><strong>Retargeting Result:</strong> Enemy Infantry squads ignore the Range squad and move backward, creating a major disadvantage</li>

                        <li>Familiars activate at different timings based on troop death percentages</li>
                        <li>Their activation can dramatically shift retargeting sequences</li>
                        <li>In 442 vs 424 scenarios, familiar timing often determines the winner</li>
                        <li>Early activation familiars (4% threshold) vs. later activation (8% threshold) create different battle dynamics</li>
                        <li>Familiar choice should complement your formation and counter the enemy's expected setup</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Scout enemy troops to confirm they have less than 1 million cavalry</li>
                    <li>Set your formation to Infantry Phalanx</li>
                    <li>Equip full infantry-focused gear, heroes, and familiars</li>
                    <li>Fill the rally with the correct 1433 troop distribution</li>
                    <li>Activate any relevant boosts or talents before launching</li>
                    <li>Launch the rally and watch for victory!</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Scout the enemy to confirm they have a low cavalry count</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Against enemy formations with <strong>less than 1.1 million ranged troops</strong></li>
                    <li>As a specialized counter against infantry / Cav-heavy compositions</li>
                    <li>When the precise troop counts can be maintained (exactly 50,000 infantry)</li>

                    <strong>Important Warning:</strong> Do NOT use 055 against compositions with more than 1.3 million ranged troops.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Spreads Infantry wider</li>
                        <li>Makes Cavalry stay back longer</li>
                        <li>Result: Cavalry survives longer, joins battle later when Range squads are already softened</li>
                        <li><strong>Range Wedge should ONLY be used AGAINST 7112 comp or 208 comp</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>NEVER use Range Wedge against heavy cavalry comps like 659</strong> - you will get destroyed</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>For enemy compositions with heavy cavalry (like 659), always use 668 comp with Cavalry Phalanx</li>
                        <li>This is the proper counter to cavalry-heavy compositions</li>
                        <li>Example: If enemy is using a 659 comp, counter with 668 in Cavalry Phalanx</li>

                <div class="note-box">
                    <strong>Important:</strong> In many 4-2-4 vs 4-2-4 Range Phalanx battles, whoever gets their Range killed FIRST often gains battle dynamics in their favor.

                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Positioning Impact:</strong> With 1 Range hero, your middle Range squad sticks out toward the enemy</li>
                        <li><strong>Retargeting Result:</strong> Enemy Infantry squads ignore the Range squad and move backward, creating a major disadvantage</li>

                    <h4>Complicated Effects of Familiars:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Familiars activate at different timings based on troop death percentages</li>
                        <li>Their activation can dramatically shift retargeting sequences</li>
                        <li>In 442 vs 424 scenarios, familiar timing often determines the winner</li>
                        <li>Early activation familiars (4% threshold) vs. later activation (8% threshold) create different battle dynamics</li>
                        <li>Familiar choice should complement your formation and counter the enemy's expected setup</li>

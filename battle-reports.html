                    <p>This is a classic Range Phalanx vs Cavalry Phalanx counter matchup. The defender chose Range Phalanx against the attacker's Cavalry Phalanx, which is theoretically correct. However, despite having higher might, the defender lost.</p>
                    
                    <div class="note-box">
                        <strong>Why the Defender Lost:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complete destruction of range front line</li>
                            <li>Likely improper hero setup (needed exactly 2 Range heroes)</li>
                            <li>Possibly wrong familiar configuration</li>
                            <li>Attacker may have had better stats or troop tiers</li>

                        <li>Range Phalanx vs Cavalry Phalanx is theoretically good but execution matters</li>
                        <li>Hero composition is critical - always use 2 Range heroes in Range Phalanx</li>
                        <li>Consider Infantry Phalanx against Cavalry Phalanx if your Range stats are weaker</li>
                        <li>Higher might doesn't guarantee victory - formation and setup are crucial</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Strategic Tip:</strong> For Range Phalanx to be effective against Cavalry Phalanx, you must use exactly 2 Range heroes and familiar combinations that activate early enough to protect your Range frontline.

                        <h4>Lessons:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Range Phalanx vs Cavalry Phalanx outcomes depend on many factors beyond just comp</li>
                            <li>Higher might doesn't guarantee victory</li>
                            <li>Proper familiar setup and hero composition can reverse expected outcomes</li>

                    <h4>Squad Retargeting & Familiar Impact:</h4>
                    <p>This battle likely demonstrates the critical retargeting mechanic: in 442 vs 424 Range Phalanx battles, the timing of when ranged squads are eliminated determines the winner.</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Retargeting Sequence:</strong> Whoever gets their Range killed FIRST often gains battle dynamics in their favor (counter-intuitive!)</li>
                        <li><strong>Familiar Activation:</strong> Pact 5 familiars activate at different times based on troop deaths:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bon Appeti & Gargantua: Activate when 4% of troops are defeated</li>
                                <li>Queen Bee & Frostwing: Activate when 8% of troops are defeated</li>
                                <li>Jade Wyrm: Reduces enemy damage by 9% when 4% of troops are defeated</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Familiar timing can dramatically shift battle dynamics - sometimes killing enemy Range faster can be detrimental!</li>

                    <strong>Strategic Tip:</strong> Don't shy away from battles against opponents with higher might if you have the correct formation, hero setup, and familiar configuration to counter their setup.

                    <h4>Key Takeaways from Battle Reports:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Formation choice is often more important than raw might</li>
                        <li>Hero composition dramatically impacts battle results - especially for Range Phalanx</li>
                        <li>Wedge formations are effective at minimizing losses in unfavorable matchups</li>
                        <li>Complete loss of front line troops almost always leads to defeat</li>
                        <li>Always analyze the specific troop composition, not just the formation name</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The battle reports confirm a clear counter pattern in formations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Range Phalanx</strong> counters <strong>Cavalry Phalanx</strong> (when executed properly)</li>
                        <li><strong>Infantry Phalanx</strong> counters <strong>Range Phalanx</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Cavalry Phalanx</strong> counters <strong>Infantry Phalanx</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Wedge formations</strong> can disrupt standard counter mechanics</li>

                    <h4>Stat vs Formation Importance:</h4>
                    <p>The battle reports demonstrate a clear hierarchy of factors impacting battle outcomes:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Formation Choice</strong> - Most important factor</li>
                        <li><strong>Hero Setup</strong> - Critical for proper squad positioning</li>
                        <li><strong>Familiar Configuration</strong> - Can tilt close battles</li>
                        <li><strong>Troop Composition</strong> - Affects overall effectiveness</li>
                        <li><strong>Stats & Might</strong> - Important but can be overcome</li>

                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Strategic Tip:</strong> Focus on mastering formation mechanics, hero positioning, and familiar timing before investing heavily in pure stat increases. A well-executed lower-might rally often beats a poorly executed higher-might one.

                <h2>Hero & Familiar Impact on Battle Outcomes</h2>
                <p>Heroes and familiars significantly influence battle mechanics beyond their direct stat contributions.</p>
                
                <div class="note-box">
                    <h4>The Two Range Heroes Rule:</h4>
                    <p>When using Range Phalanx, always use <strong>exactly two Range Heroes</strong>. This applies to 4-2-4, 4-4-2, or 2-4-4 variants.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using only one Range hero creates a positioning disadvantage where your middle Range squad sticks out toward the enemy</li>
                        <li>Using no Range heroes causes your Infantry squads to protrude forward, creating an even worse disadvantage</li>
                        <li>Using three Range heroes induces a similar harmful mechanism to having just one</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><strong>Formation Dynamics:</strong> Hero placement can dramatically change how your troops interact with enemy formations</li>
                        <li><strong>Retargeting Dynamics:</strong> With proper hero placement, you can influence which enemy squads target which of your squads</li>

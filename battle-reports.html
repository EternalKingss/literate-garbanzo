                    <li>Attacker (Cavalry Phalanx) lost 1.2M cavalry (most of front line)</li>
                    <li>Defender (Range Phalanx) lost ALL range troops (1.1M)</li>

                <h4 class="step-title">Battle Analysis:</h4>
                <p>This is a classic Range Phalanx vs Cavalry Phalanx counter matchup. The defender chose Range Phalanx against the attacker's Cavalry Phalanx, which is theoretically correct. However, despite having higher might, the defender lost.</p>

                    <strong>Why the Defender Lost:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Complete destruction of range front line</li>
                        <li>Likely improper hero setup (needed exactly 2 Range heroes)</li>
                        <li>Possibly wrong familiar configuration</li>

                <h4>Lessons Learned:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Range Phalanx vs Cavalry Phalanx is theoretically good but execution matters</li>
                    <li>Hero composition is critical - always use 2 Range heroes in Range Phalanx</li>
                    <li>Consider Infantry Phalanx against Cavalry Phalanx if your Range stats are weaker</li>
                    <li>Higher might doesn't guarantee victory - formation and setup are crucial</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Critical Hero Rule:</strong> Using exactly 2 Range heroes in Range Phalanx is essential - this affects squad positioning and retargeting mechanics</li>
                    <li><strong>Hero Composition:</strong> For Range Phalanx, the ideal is a 122 hero comp (1 Infantry/2 Range/2 Cavalry)</li>
                    <li><strong>Hero Tactical Skills:</strong> Heroes with tactical skills create positioning advantages that affect battle outcomes</li>
                    <li><strong>Familiar Activation:</strong> Pact 5 familiars like Jade Wyrm and Queen Bee can dramatically shift battle dynamics based on timing</li>

                <p>In this battle, the attacker with Cavalry Phalanx defeated a defender with Range Phalanx, despite the defender having significantly higher might. This demonstrates that might isn't always the determining factor in battles.</p>

                <h4>Squad Retargeting & Familiar Impact:</h4>
                <p>This battle likely demonstrates the critical retargeting mechanic: in 442 vs 424 Range Phalanx battles, the timing of when ranged squads are eliminated determines the winner.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Bon Appeti & Gargantua: Activate when 4% of troops are defeated</li>
                            <li>Queen Bee & Frostwing: Activate when 8% of troops are defeated</li>
                            <li>Jade Wyrm: Reduces enemy damage by 9% when 4% of troops are defeated</li>

                    <li>Formation choice is often more important than raw might</li>
                    <li>Hero composition dramatically impacts battle results - especially for Range Phalanx</li>
                    <li>Wedge formations are effective at minimizing losses in unfavorable matchups</li>
                    <li>Complete loss of front line troops almost always leads to defeat</li>

                    <h4>The Two Range Heroes Rule:</h4>
                    <p>When using Range Phalanx, always use <strong>exactly two Range Heroes</strong>. This applies to 4-2-4, 4-4-2, or 2-4-4 variants.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using only one Range hero creates a positioning disadvantage where your middle Range squad sticks out toward the enemy</li>
                        <li>Using no Range heroes causes your Infantry squads to protrude forward, creating an even worse disadvantage</li>
                        <li>Using three Range heroes induces a similar harmful mechanism to having just one</li>
                    </ul>
